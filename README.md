# Pegasus Autocode Interpreter


This is an experimental interpreter for Autocode for the Ferranti Pegasus.

The parser is written in Python using yapps2, which is a prerequsite.

The parser is complete and the next steps will be to

* add parser actions to create Intepretable objects
* add a top-level driver, and finally
* add some documentation and sample programs
